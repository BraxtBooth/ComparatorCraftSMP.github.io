					<h3>Application Questions</h3>
					<br>
					<h4>Why do I have to apply to join the server?</h4>
					<p>
						We maintain an <a href="ApplyPage.html">application system</a> to
						preserve the integrity of our server and ensure that it is a fun
						and friendly place for all of our players.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h4>How old do I have to be to apply?</h4>
					<p>
						In order to preserve a mature and active player base, we do have a
						15+ age restriction, though we do create exceptions for 14 year-olds
						who show a lot of talent, skill, and passion for the game.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<h3>Server Questions</h3>
					<br>
					<h4>What is the plan for updating the server?</h4>
					<p>
						The server will not be fully resetting for the 1.17 update, but all
						chunks outside of 30,000XY will be reloaded as 1.17 chunks. The
						server will be fully reset for the second part of the update to
						allow for the brand new cave and mountain generation.
					</p>

					<h4>What is a hermitcraft like server?</h4>

					<h3>Donating Questions</h3>
					<br>
					<h4>Should I donate?</h4>
					<p>
						While it is not required, we do greatly appreciate support from donors,
						which allow us to pay for the hardware and services that keep the server
						running. If you would like to donate to the server, you can do so via our
						<a href="http://patreon.com/comparatorcraftsmp">Patreon</a> or

					<p>
						Different tiers are assigned based on the amount donated. The perks of
						each tier can be found on our <a href="#">donate</a> page, or in the
						#donate channel in our discord. None of the perks provide any in-game
						advantage, and abide to
						<a href="https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula">
							Mojang's EULA
						</a>.
					</p><br>
					<h4>If I Am a gold tier donor, do I have to pay full price for Emerald/Diamond?</h4>
					<p>

						Gold to Emerald will require a $12 donation etc.
